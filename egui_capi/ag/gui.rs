/// * `content_rect`: the rectangle that is made available to the inner [`Ui`] or widget.
/// * `fill_rect`: the rectangle that is filled with the fill color (inside the stroke, if any).
/// * `widget_rect`: is the interactive part of the widget (what sense clicks etc).
/// * `outer_rect`: what is allocated in the outer [`Ui`], and is what is returned by [`Response::rect`].
